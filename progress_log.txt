# report 1

During first ~2 weeks I created model classes like Board, CardList etc., service for actions, And also basic structure
of the project with models, service (for handling models), controllers (for fronts actions), and views.

no actual testing yet

no major problems yet.

Time spent at the moment is about 10h. I'm maybe little late from the plan because of current workload
on other courses but not by much.

# report 2

More functionality to models, Filemanager etc.

implementing tests next up


Time spent ~4hours
